The NFL has denied Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson's appeal of a season-long suspension, league spokesman Greg Aiello tweeted Friday night. The decision was made by appeals officer Harold Henderson. Henderson said, `` I conclude that the player has not demonstrated that the process and procedures surrounding his discipline were not fair and consistent, '' according to Aiello's tweet. In November, Peterson was suspended without pay for the rest of the 2014 season because he violated the league's personal conduct policy `` in an incident of abusive discipline that he inflicted on his 4-year-old son last May, '' the league said. The National Football League Players Association said : `` The NFLPA expected this outcome, given the hearing officer's relationship and financial ties to the NFL. The decision itself ignores the facts, the evidence and the collective bargaining agreement. `` This decision also represents the NFL's repeated failure to adhere to due process and confirms its inconsistent treatment of players. Our union is considering immediate legal remedies.

Add another entry to the growing list of crazy footage captured by GoPro cameras. NASA posted a video this week of three astronauts playing with a floating, softball-sized water bubble aboard the International Space Station. That's been done before, but the trio added a new wrinkle : They put a sealed GoPro inside the bubble, creating an orbiting `` bubblecam '' that helped document the feat.

Entertainment Weekly reports that, as a way of rebooting the successful series, Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-800 isn't the villain he was in the first film, but closer to the reprogrammed version he was in `` Terminator 2 : Judgment Day. '' And Connor is an orphan who's been raised by T-800 and isn't all that comfortable with the future she's been told about. `` Since she was 9 years old, she has been told everything that was supposed to happen, '' producer David Ellison told EW. `` But Sarah fundamentally rejects that destiny. She says, ` That's not what I want to do.'It's her decision that drives the story in a very different direction.

Iraq and Turkey have agreed to allow flights between their countries, ending a mutual ban that began with a dispute about how an Iraqi government oil company owed millions of dollars to Turkey, Iraqi officials said Thursday. Turkish planes resumed flights to Iraq on Thursday and were landing at the Baghdad airport, Iraq's Ministry of Transportation said.

Both countries agreed to drop the bans after negotiations. After years of the U.S.-led war in Iraq, Turkey's flagship carrier Turkish Airlines was one of the first international companies to begin

Oregon will not defend the state's same-sex marriage ban in court because the law would not stand up to a federal constitutional challenge, the state's attorney general said Thursday. However, Ellen Rosenblum said in legal documents that the state is legally obligated to enforce the state's ban on same-sex marriage while a federal lawsuit is litigated.

'' Meanwhile, Rosenblum said officials are legally obligated to enforce the ban until the court makes a ruling.

Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The latest video ad from the Republican Senate campaign arm accuses Michelle Nunn, the Democratic Senate candidate in Georgia, of supporting amnesty.

Sanaa, Yemen -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thirty-eight al Qaeda militants were killed in clashes with Yemen's military, local security officials said Friday. At least 15 troops also died in the violence Thursday morning in the southern provinces of Abyan and Lahjj, the officials said.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Myanmar's Supreme Court rejected Friday an appeal by pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi to overturn her house arrest. A diplomat who attended the hearing and spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed that the appeal was unsuccessful. Suu Kyi, 64, has one final avenue for appeal to a special court in Myanmar's new capital, Naypidaw.

Myanmar's ruling military junta accused Suu Kyi of breaching the terms of her house arrest. She has been imprisoned or under house arrest for much of the past two decades, since her party the National League for Democracy won a landslide election victory in 1990. The junta has never recognized the results, but has promised to hold fresh elections this year, although no date has yet been set. Suu Kyi

WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. Navy released nine of the 16 suspected pirates it was holding on a ship for the last few weeks, according to defense officials. The U.S. Navy apprehends suspected pirates February 12 in the Gulf of Arden.

Russian forces have been operating in Chechnya since Boris Yeltsin's order in 1999.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory in Bangladesh last week, which killed more than 500 workers, has highlighted serious issues with safety and poor pay for garment workers in the country.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It's not shocking to see a woman talking on her cell phone while walking down the street. It is, however, shocking when the woman is an extra in a silent film from 1928. Charlie Chaplin's `` The Circus '' is getting internet buzz with a clip from the black-and-white comedy spreading at viral speed. The clip -- a DVD extra spotted by filmmaker George Clarke -- shows a woman holding what some say appears to be a mobile phone to her ear and talking. The only explanation : She's a time traveler. At least that's the word on the Web. In the late 1920s, Chaplin was nominated for an Academy Award for acting, writing, directing and producing `` The Circus, '' but he was taken out of the running and presented with a `` Special Award '' instead. Perhaps the Academy didn't think it was fair to include him in the race -- what with the use of technology from the future and all.
