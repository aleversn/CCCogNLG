Rosen	Oregon will not defend the state's same-sex marriage ban in court because the law would not stand up to a federal constitutional challenge, the state's attorney general said Thursday. However, Ellen Rosenblum said in legal documents that the state is legally obligated to enforce the state's ban on same-sex marriage while a federal lawsuit is litigated. Oregon filed the documents in response to the lawsuit challenging the ban. Oregon voters passed Measure 36 in 2004, which amended the state's Constitution to define marriage as between one man and a woman. In 2013, the state's chief operating officer directed state agencies to recognize same-sex marriages that were legally performed in other states. Thursday's response ended by saying the state will not defend the Oregon ban on same-sex marriage because it `` can not withstand a federal constitutional challenge under any standard of review. '' Meanwhile, Rosenblum said officials are legally obligated to enforce the ban until the court makes a ruling.

Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The latest video ad from the Republican Senate campaign arm accuses Michelle Nunn, the Democratic Senate candidate in Georgia, of supporting amnesty. Seems like the usual in hyper-partisan Washington, right? But in attacking the Democratic candidate, the ad also lumps in more than a dozen Republicans, including a rising GOP star who might run for president in 2016. `` Michelle Nunn proudly supports Obama's amnesty plan for illegal immigrants '' flashes across the screen during the 30-second spot. But the ad cites a Politico story in which Nunn expressed her support for a Senate immigration bill that passed with the support of 14 Republicans, who were led by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, who is widely viewed as a potential 2016 presidential candidate. It wouldn't be the first time conservatives have painted Rubio's support for immigration reform as pro-amnesty, but the National Republican Senatorial Committee ad is an attack on Republican supporters of immigration reform from the establishment

Existing rules say the Roman Catholic Church's cardinals should start voting on a replacement from 15 to 20 days after the papal throne becomes vacant. With Benedict's resignation due to start February 28, the cardinals'conclave ordinarily would start no sooner than March 15. But Lombardi has said that because Benedict was leaving the papacy through resignation rather than death, the Vatican would explore the possibility of selecting a new pope sooner than normally prescribed.

Charlie Chaplin's `` The Circus '' is getting internet buzz with a clip from the black-and-white comedy spreading at viral speed. The clip -- a DVD extra spotted by filmmaker George Clarke -- shows a woman holding what some say appears to be a mobile phone to her ear and talking. The only explanation : She's a time traveler. At least that's the word on the Web. In the late 1920s, Chaplin was nominated for an Academy Award for acting, writing, directing and producing `` The Circus, '' but he was taken out of the running and presented with a `` Special Award '' instead. Perhaps the Academy didn't think it was fair to include him in the race -- what with the use of technology from the future and all.
